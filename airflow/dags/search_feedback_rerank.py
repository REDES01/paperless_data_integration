"""
Search feedback reranker DAG.

Hourly aggregation of user thumbs-up/down feedback into per-document stats
that ml_gateway reads at query time to rerank search results.

Task graph:
    aggregate_feedback  ─▶  notify_result

Runs hourly so that feedback submitted in the UI is reflected in rankings
within an hour, not 24 hours. Uses PythonOperators (scheduler-local SQL)
rather than DockerOperator — the aggregation is a few SQL statements and
doesn't need an isolated image.

For ml_gateway to read the output, document_feedback_stats must exist in
the ML Postgres (schema migration 03_search_feedback_stats.sql).
